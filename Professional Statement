I am a strategic, mission-oriented professional transitioning into cybersecurity after a decade leading operations in military intelligence and healthcare. My core strengths include critical thinking under pressure, disciplined execution, and a strong analytical mindset—skills developed through leading classified operations in the U.S. Air Force and later managing clinical systems and compliance in multi-site healthcare organizations. I am currently building hands-on experience through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and personal lab projects, with a focus on blue team principles, risk identification, and incident response.

What draws me to cybersecurity is its real-world impact—protecting people, organizations, and infrastructure from threats that can cause genuine harm. I value integrity, precision, and the ethical responsibility of securing sensitive data and systems. I am especially driven by the opportunity to bring calm, clarity, and structure to chaotic or high-stakes environments—something I’ve done my entire career in both government and private sectors.

I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity goals of forward-thinking organizations by applying my operational leadership, growing technical skills, and commitment to lifelong learning. Whether in a government or enterprise environment, my goal is to help teams proactively reduce risk, strengthen defenses, and ensure long-term resilience.
