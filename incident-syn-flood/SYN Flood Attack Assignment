# Cybersecurity Incident Report: SYN Flood Attack

## Section 1: Identify the Attack

### Name of Attack:
SYN Flood Attack (Type: Denial-of-Service - DoS)

### Description:
A SYN flood is a denial-of-service attack that targets the TCP three-way handshake. The attacker sends a high volume of TCP SYN packets to the target server without completing the handshake. This causes the server to allocate resources for incomplete connections, leading to resource exhaustion and an inability to process legitimate requests.

### Method of Detection:
- An automated alert was triggered by the monitoring system.
- Manual attempts to access the company’s website resulted in connection timeout errors.
- Wireshark packet capture revealed:
  - Repeated SYN packets from the IP address `203.0.113.0`
  - No corresponding ACK responses to complete the handshake
  - Numerous [RST, ACK] packets and HTTP 504 Gateway Time-out errors from the server
  - Normal employee traffic was increasingly denied or interrupted

### Traffic Behavior:
- The attacker sent a large number of TCP SYN packets without completing handshakes.
- The server responded with SYN-ACKs but did not receive final ACKs.
- This pattern repeated rapidly, resulting in server resource exhaustion.
- Legitimate connections from employee IP addresses could not be processed.

## Section 2: Analyze the Impact

### Affected Systems:
- Web server (IP: `192.0.2.1`)
- Internal employee workstations (IP range: `198.51.100.0/24`)

### Network and Website Impact:
- The server became overwhelmed by half-open connections and could not complete new connections.
- Employees were unable to access the company website or retrieve sales data.
- Legitimate network traffic was either dropped or returned timeout and reset errors.

### Business Consequences:
- Temporary disruption of business operations.
- Inaccessibility of internal tools and sales platform.
- Potential financial losses and reputational damage.
- Increased workload on IT and security teams to resolve the incident.

## Section 3: Response and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Taken:
- The web server was taken offline temporarily to free up resources and recover.
- The malicious IP address `203.0.113.0` was blocked using the firewall.
- Ongoing network monitoring was initiated to verify that no additional sources were involved.

### Recommended Preventive Measures:
- Enable SYN cookies on the web server to protect against SYN flood attacks.
- Configure rate limiting on the firewall to reduce the risk of resource exhaustion.
- Deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect anomalous traffic patterns.
- Utilize a web application firewall (WAF) to mitigate similar attack types.
- Evaluate third-party DDoS mitigation services such as Cloudflare or AWS Shield.
- Review and update the organization’s incident response and mitigation protocols.
